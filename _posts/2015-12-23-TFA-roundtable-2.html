<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: In <a href="{% post_url 2015-12-19-TFA-roundtable-1 %}">part one</a> of our roundtable, we discussed the overall plot, but as fans of the films, we felt that Han's and Leia's story deserves special attention. In terms of their emotional connection in “The Force Awakens,” I was pretty underwhelmed. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor, but even I can acknowledge that he’s lost a few steps since the last time he was Han Solo. At this point in his career, his basic mode is “grizzled, and maybe a bit overwhelmed.” While this can work in some movies -- it’s nothing great, but I like “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom the Crystal Skull” a lot more than your average moviegoer -- it doesn’t really fit Han’s image as a smooth, quick-thinking smuggler. As for Leia, she was practically a new character to me. The script, by Michael Arndt and director J.J. Abrams and “Empire” and “Jedi” writer Lawrence Kasdan, didn’t really give her dialogue that sounded like the character I knew. Plus, and I don’t want to be rude, but her voice was so gravelly and different that there was a real sense of cognitive dissonance every time she spoke.</p>

<p><b>Mark</b>: I was not really impressed with the returning characters either. Han was probably the best of the bunch, but I wasn't really feeling it. His death was particularly disappointing. Han is a great character, and I love him in the original trilogy, but the weight of his death just didn’t hit me.</p>

<p>Plus the Han/Leia love story from the originals is completely destroyed for me. Sure they get together at the end of ROTJ, but we never actually see them together. Their romance doesn’t have any of the staying power it feels like it should. We just zoom forward 30 years, and it turns out they’re just doing their own thing. I understand the point that they’ve had some devastating life events (what with their son going all Vader on them), but I would have much rather seen them together. I’m tired of the romances that are all about the spark in the beginning. I can never feel good for their relationship since I know where it is headed.</p>

<p><b>Vanasse</b>: Oh, I disagree. I think that their interactions from this one show how much staying power they had and how it really required a terrible, terrible thing to break them up. You can tell that staying apart was painful for them. Unlike say, Barney and Robin on “How I Met Your Mother,” where the producers try to force a sweet romance and acknowledge later that it never would have worked, you can tell that Han and Leia are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" target="_blank">OTP</a> and it takes some really serious shit to keep them apart.</p>

<p>You can also see that the lives they were leading to block out the pain of their son were never really fulfilling. I might be reading into it a bit much, and maybe it’s partly the nostalgia or previous affection talking, but you could tell once they were back together that that was right, and the stuff on the salvage ship was wrong. Han+Leia OTP, and I’m just sad that we were never given a chance to see them come back together (except maybe as force ghosts?).</p>

<p>However, I will admit that I would be amused if Lando swept in in VIII for some comforting.</p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: Oh, Lando. When this movie was announced, he was the only one of the original cast (besides the droids) I would have liked to see back, and that’s pretty much still true after watching the movie. However, I wanted to respond to your “How I Met Your Mother” analogy, because I was thinking about that show as well.</p>

<p>For non-HIMYM watchers, the story of CBS’s departed hit is ostensibly about how the main character, Ted, meets the mother of his children. In the future, an older Ted is telling his kids the story of his early adulthood, and how it all tied together to bring him in contact, finally, with the woman of his dreams. The final season of the show takes place over one weekend: that of the wedding of two of Ted’s closest friends, Barney and Robin, the latter of whom had many fans who wanted to see her end up with Ted. In a move so boneheaded it’s hard to imagine what HIMYM’s writers were thinking, the season spends its entire run, through the second to last episode, explaining why Barney and Robin are meant for each other, attempting to make you believe the romance and perhaps allow Ted to move on. In the series finale, however, they hastily break up the duo’s marriage, kill the kids’ mom offscreen, and tie it up with Ted and Robin ending up together after all.</p>

<p>And the whole time I was watching it, I was thinking, “That’s not how storytelling works.”</p>

<p>That’s doubly true when the story is ostensibly narrated by a guy telling his kids about his life (why would Ted spend so much time talking about how great Barney and Robin were together when the reality is so different?), but I think it applies here, as well. “Return of the Jedi,” by its very nature, is meant to be a happy ending. It’s implied that the Empire is severely crippled, if not entirely slain, that Luke is on the path to Jedi success, and that Han and Leia end up together. To basically return to them in the midst of elderly ennui -- seemingly divorced, with an evil child, and ultimately ending with Han murdered by his own kid -- retroactively recontextualizes the original films as bleak when they are meant to be hopeful. It’s like that fake “Calvin and Hobbes” final <a href="https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40ca9a768f510158334b8635e3c74c7c?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">comic</a> where Calvin takes ADHD medication and can no longer see his tiger come to life. It’s missing the point for something “more realistic,” when that’s not what the original was about.</p>

<p><b>Bethany</b>: We totally agree about HIMYM. However, the difference with HIMYM and "The Force Awakens" is that Robin and Barney really should have never been together in the first place. They spent several seasons setting up that they're different people who wanted different things, and tried to change Barney to fit into a mold, only to revert him back to his original nature. And the reason they broke up was just sort of lame.</p>

<p>Whereas Han and Leia were met for each other. But life happens, and that's realistic. Would I like them together? Sure, I guess. But the reason for them not being together makes total sense. And I think any sort of change they make to any of the original trilogy characters will recontextualize them. Han/Leia having an evil son does that. Luke running away and hiding does that. I think it’s inescapable.</p>

<p>I think you guys, Ryan H. and Mark, are being too critical. First, you complain that everything is too similar, and then you complain that the characters are too different. You mentioned 30+ years have passed. It would seem unrealistic to me if the characters just picked right back up where they were. Of course Han was smooth in his prime, but now he's been grizzled by time and a relationship he wanted to last but just couldn't make work. Leia was a princess with military prowess, so of course she threw herself into that, especially as the The First Order rises up. I for one was glad they didn't have them together. The two of them having a son together that grows up to become Darth Vader 2.0 would be traumatic, and I feel unrealistic had they still been together.</p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: What you’re saying about character change may hold some truth, but I think it’s also based on the assumption that the old characters needed to be in the movie at all, which I think is false and only hurts the film. Speaking of that, however, we should pivot to Han and Leia’s son, Kylo Ren, as well as the three other human leads of the movie. For our next roundtable, that’s exactly what we’ll do.</p>
