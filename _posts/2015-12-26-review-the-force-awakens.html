<p>We hope you've been enjoying our roundtable of "The Force Awakens," but in case you wanted to see a more formal review one of us wrote about the movie, you can <a href="https://matineeculture.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/star-wars-the-force-awakens-seventh-verse-same-as-the-first/" target="_blank">check out Ryan's write-up</a> at our sister blog, Matinee Culture.</p>
