<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: We're back after a brief hiatus over the holidays! On <a href="{% post_url 2015-12-29-TFA-roundtable-3 %}">our last “The Force Awakens” roundtable</a>, we discussed Kylo Ren and Rey, and while those two characters may be the meatiest of the film's new characters, now we'll delve into some of the movie's other new offerings. Bethany, what did you think of Finn and Poe?</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: Finn as the ultimately good guy in a bad situation, with the same teenage/early 20s thoughts and feelings we all have had, was definitely a highlight for me. The intensity but also playfulness of John Boyega fit right into the Star Wars universe better than most. And there's Poe. I mean, we all knew he wasn’t dead, but still, seeing him again, and seeing him and Finn so excited to see each other, just warmed my heart, let me tell you.</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: I didn’t think there was as much to Finn as I was hoping for. As mentioned in the plot discussion in part I, the “fallen stormtrooper” aspect isn’t played very deeply, and you’re definitely left wanting more on that side of things. He makes his choices really abruptly too—his decision to suddenly leave to the outer rim at Maz’s was so jarring, and so not fitting with what we’d seen to that point, that I thought, “What’s going on?” It was seeing someone with lots of enthusiasm but not necessarily a ton of competence (ha, because he’s a stormtrooper!) but I don’t know that I connected with him very well on a first viewing.</p>

<p>Poe doesn’t really get a lot to do but be an awesome pilot, so the CGI handles most of his character for him.</p>

<p>Basically, I liked them both, but especially with Poe I don’t know that there was much to grab onto.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: I loved Finn. I thought Boyega was very convincing. I didn’t mind the sparse backstory. The opening scene of him refusing to slaughter the village was well done (even behind the mask). His relationship with Rey was the best part of her character; he and Daisy Ridley have good chemistry (far more than, say, Anakin and Padme).</p>

<p>As far as Poe is concerned, I didn’t see him coming back. I expected him to be a throwaway character, so every time he disappeared I thought he was really gone. I thought he did fine, but there wasn’t too much to the character beyond his piloting.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: I agree with Vanasse that neither of the characters get a lot to do (especially Poe), but that’s a fault of the retro-obsessed script, not the characters themselves. I found Boyega and Oscar Isaac utterly charming every moment they were on screen, and their scene in the TIE fighter just crackles. It’s the clearest glimpse we have into what this movie could have been if it wasn’t constantly looking over its shoulder.</p>

<p>That said, I think Finn gets some solid character work in whenever he can. Though he should have been given more room to breathe, and his dialogue sounds a teensy bit more like a J.J. Abrams character than a Star Wars character, he’s sincere, passionate, and, most importantly, funny. A lot of crap gets laid at the prequels’ door, much justified, some unjustified, but one of the most compelling complaints is that they’re relatively humorless (save for the valiant efforts of Ewan McGregor, furtively glancing around for someone, anyone else to crack a smile). Finn is the comedic driver for this movie, unless you count the Millennium Falcon’s diarrhea of “New Hope” references, and he wears the role well.</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: You really need to take it easy on the nostalgia-hating.</p>

<p>I want to mention a couple of small secondary new characters. First: Captain Phasma. Badass silver stormtrooper? Awesome. She seems pretty intimidating in the early parts of the movie. Doesn’t get a ton to do but eh, still works it. But then when Han and Finn crash the Starkiller Base party, she turns off the shields on the whole place with just a threat? Why did we build this character up when she was going to end up sucking so bad?</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been reading some commentary that argues that she should have been the person who kicks Finn’s butt with that saber-resistant bo staff (a gadget first conceived of in Episode III, if you recall), and I think that’s right. If we are to believe this character is important or cool, she should be shown doing something important or cool. Instead -- and I promise I’ll try to make this my last one, Ryan -- she is unceremoniously hurled into a Episode IV reference, not to be heard from until the next movie.</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: I’ll allow it, if only because that reference was easily the most heavy-handed and worst “wink-wink” one in the whole movie.</p>

<p>Next new character: Snoke. That is “Supreme Leader Snoke,” the literally huge leader of the First Order. Ughhhhh, I hated this. The character design is super “generic 2015 CGI bad guy,” they do this “is he giant or is the hologram just big” fakeout thing, he’s got a terrible name, and he does way too much exposition. Every time I saw him I was taken out of the illusion that this was Star Wars and reminded that I’m watching an action movie from 2015. He could have been Thanos from Avengers, for all we know. I realize that in this movie he’s really a nothing character that does nothing and so why should I care, but I really really hated him.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: I feel probably much more indifferent about Snoke than the rest, but I think he was probably the weakest part of all of this. When he first showed up on screen, I threw my hands up in the air in indignation. “Really? A giant villain? We get literally a giant villain?” I was relieved when he was a hologram, but that didn’t make his character any better. I would have rather seen the disembodied head of a somehow resurrected Palpatine than this random new guy who is supposed to be super evil, we assume. And it seems like he's also supposed to be super old, but relatively new in the grand scheme of Star Wars warmongers. OK, maybe I’m not indifferent; I think I kind of hated him, too, but not enough for it to impact my final thoughts because he really is such a throwaway character in this film.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Hey, another thing we can all agree on! On this, at least, you can join me in letting the hate flow through you. I wasn’t aggressively angry at Snoke, besides his super non-threatening name, but I found him pretty generic and forgettable. Where Kylo Ren makes a unique impression as a volatile man-child with a lightsaber, Snoke leaves virtually no impression at all, other than that he looks like giant, CGI Voldemort. And honestly, the CGI doesn’t even seem necessary, unless it’s all about making him big. Peter Jackson did more impressive work in prosthetics for the Lord of the Rings movies than this one does for Snoke’s CGI, and those movies are more than 10 years old!</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: Well since we’re on the topic of these CGI characters, I will mention that I really did like Maz. I read something that likened her to this trilogy’s Yoda, and while I don’t totally agree, I also kind of like that comparison. She does seem like a very convenient character, spouting advice and conveniently having Luke’s lightsaber tucked away, but as a character in general, I liked her. Plus, she lets the movie pass the Bechdel Test.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Maz didn’t leave a huge impression on me (it was only after reading online that I realized that she could be seen as the movie’s Yoda, an interpretation I agree with). However, one thing I did take note of is that she’s exactly the kind of character people would decry if she was in the prequel movies instead.</p>

<p>Gruff old CGI alien who hangs out in a bar? Hmm, sounds to me an awful lot like Dexter Jettster, from Episode II. There’s even a touch -- just the slightest, mind you, but a touch nonetheless -- of Jar-Jar to her, what with her magnifying glasses that serve no purpose other than a visual gag (think about Jar-Jar’s ears that hit him in the face as he walks). I’m not saying I minded those character quirks (and I actually like Dexter Jettster, so it’s no skin off my nose), but I do think what love the character is receiving is mostly due to people giving her a pass in a post-Lucas world.</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: For me, her problem is more the scene she’s in, which is paced really fast and has no time to breathe. She’s really more like Guinan from “Star Trek: TNG,” who is wise and knows things that are important to the plot “just because.” She was important to the plot, but I certainly didn’t get much of a read on her character at all.</p>

<p>It’s interesting from a world-building sense because I think that in the original trilogy, we’ve got lots of examples of very small things that provide us a window on a character who isn’t important at all. The classic example is the Rancor keeper from ROTJ, who is just devastated when Luke kills the Rancor. No lines, just a small part in the thing, but it makes him a fully realized person. Meanwhile, with Maz, she gets a bunch of lines, has this unique environment, but feels more like a plot device than any sort of character.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Agreed. Your mention of the Rancor and his keeper is a good place to transition, I think, because I don’t think this film has many of those little moments. The Rancor master’s tears work in part because of the way the Rancor dies -- not with a roar, but with a sad face and a dog’s forlorn whimper. Over the next two roundtables, we’ll talk about the CGI and art direction in “The Force Awakens,” perhaps including some other process elements as the discussion unfolds.</p>
