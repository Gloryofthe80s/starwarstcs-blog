  		<h1>WHAT IS THIS PLACE?</h1>
			<p>Star Wars: The Completionist Saga is a blog in which four writers (and perhaps a few guests along the way) explore the entirety of Star Wars stories committed to the screen, wonder how they all fit together, and decide which parts are essential viewing and which parts can be thrown to the sarlacc. As we delve into the saga, we'll also share our other thoughts on Star Wars – perhaps our connections to the novels, or the video games, or the original Decipher Customizable Card Game that we're still collecting for some reason. Learn more about the premise of the blog here, catch up on our official takes on the various movies and TV shows here, and read our other bits of Star Wars ephemera here.</p>

						<p class="name">Mark Rustad</p>

						<p>Mark Rustad is a software engineer in Minnesota. His first memory of Star Wars was his younger brother getting freaked out by Darth Vader choking the Rebel trooper in the opening scene of Episode IV. This delayed his first viewing of Star Wars until he was in Junior High. Since then, he has grown to love the Star Wars saga. He enjoys other nerdoms including Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, and other fantasy/science fiction.</p>

						<p>He lives with his wife, Megan, in the Twin Cities.</p>
