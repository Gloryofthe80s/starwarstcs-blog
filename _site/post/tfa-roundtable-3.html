            <div class="post-content">
              <p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: In our first mega-discussion of “The Force Awakens,” split into <a href="/post/tfa-roundtable-1">part one</a> and <a href="/post/tfa-roundtable-2">two</a>, we talked about the overarching plot of the film as well as the dynamics between Han and Leia, the two characters from the original movies with the most significant part to play. This time, we’ll be jawing over two of the four main new characters -- Kylo Ren and Rey -- before adding our two cents about Poe, Finn and a few of the minor new characters next time.</p>

<p>Bethany, we ended our last discussion poised to talk about Kylo Ren, so let’s jump into that first, shall we? What did you think of Ben Solo (or is it Organa)? I found him quite interesting, but also the new character I was most conflicted about.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: I thought he was a great villain, and super badass, even compared to Darth Vader. They did a great job of setting him up as evil and actually threatening. And not just with basic character set-up techniques, but with music and sound too. Better than Palpatine or Darth Maul.</p>

<p>I will say, I initially laughed, actually laughed out loud in the theater, when he took off his helmet. I had done a great job of avoiding most all spoilers, so I had no idea who would possibly be playing Kylo Ren, and he just looked super nerdy. But Adam Driver did a fantastic job of keeping a level of intensity even with the mask off that made me immediately stop laughing and take him extremely seriously, which I thought was just fantastic.</p>

<p>If we want to talk about things we wish we would have seen, however, I definitely wish I would have seen/understood better the family dynamic going on between Ben and Han/Leia. I also felt they could have spent more time with Kylo since he was such a strong character. In particular, I would have liked to better understand his personal struggle or even see that he really has one, other than the few seconds on the bridge right before he kills Han (which may or may not have even been indicative of said struggle; that is yet to be seen). </p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Wow, you have a totally different take on the character from what I came away with. Oddly enough, I thought it was an incredibly interesting choice – one of the only interesting choices in the whole movie, as a matter of fact – that the film made Kylo Ren out to be super whiny and kind of shitty. I definitely think this was intentional, and I am utterly intrigued by it.</p>

<p>The movie sort of fakes you out about this in the beginning, when he uses the Force to stop a blaster bolt and reads Poe’s mind, but it quickly becomes clear that something is off about this guy. When he can’t recover BB-8 right away, he throws a legitimate temper tantrum in the control room, slashing at some expensive ship controls like an impotent 3-year-old. Then, we discover that he’s basically a wheezy Darth Vader fanboy. He wears a Vader-esque helmet for no reason other than he thinks it looks cool, and his motivation is some emo bullshit about wanting to be bad but being tempted by the good. Then, we finally see him take his mask off, and he’s kind of a soft-spoken dweeb. At that moment, hearing his pouty voice whine about how things can’t go the way he wants, I realized something that I’m almost sure is true: Adam Driver is intentionally channeling Hayden Christensen from Episodes II and III. Like whiny emo Anakin from those films, he’s constantly frustrated that he’s not living up to his perceived potential, living in the shadow of expectations he’ll never be able to fulfill, and it kills him.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: I guess. But if you’re going to have issues with characters being whiny in Star Wars, you’re going to have issues with a lot of characters, including Luke. It’s kind of not Star Wars if the main character isn’t a little whiny.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: No, I’m not complaining that he’s whiny. I’m saying that his whininess is a fascinating move that doesn’t always work, but one that is to be lauded for its boldness. An ineffectual main baddie is a new thing in these movies, and that’s great in a movie that is short on new things.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: Well, we can agree on him being whiny (though maybe not to the extent), and agree that it isn’t necessarily a negative in these movies. I don’t agree, however, that he resembles Anakin here. Maybe that will change with multiple viewings, but having watched Episodes I and II most recently, Anakin never came off as strong, powerful, or threatening. I think the juxtaposition of Anakin starting off good and eventually turning bad, and the opposite being true for Kylo (though it's yet to be determined if he ever does turn good, of course), is a great way to differentiate the characters and start something a little new with these next set of films. As I mentioned, I see the similarities of the characters being a little whiny, but see that with Luke as well and just chalk it up to a family trait. Same with the bad temper. But I cannot in good conscious equate whiny, annoying Hayden Christensen with whiny, strong, badass Kylo.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Fascinating. When we were first introduced to Kylo, I thought he was pretty sweet. His tantrum slicing that computer to shreds was chilling. He had some real hot rage, which is unique for Star Wars villains up to this point. However, the instant he took his mask off, he no longer seemed threatening to me. A family trait, sure, but an incredibly annoying one that has always bothered me (even for Luke). The emo act is so bad. I like the idea of his internal struggles in principle: the temptation towards the dark side, the need to kill his father to complete his journey, etc. But in the end I don’t find it compelling. For whatever reason, the mask makes his acting more believable for me. I really like Kylo with his mask, but really disliked Kylo without his mask. </p>

<p>If he is trying to channel Christensen, I think it was a bad move. It simply doesn’t work for me.</p>

<p class="caption">Awesome, angsty, or both?</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: You’re both picking up interesting threads here, because while I liked Ren’s odd characterization, you’ve both brought up areas where I didn't quite buy the character. In addition to not resonating with his family motivations -- and again, this can be blamed on the script, which decides to throw in some “Empire” callbacks on top of its “New Hope” remake without realizing that the reason the “I am your father” fight works is because we’ve spent two whole movies with these people – I found myself not buying his emotional turmoil and being confused throughout the movie if he was supposed to be a badass or not.</p>

<p>Basically, the stated motivation for Ren is that he really wants to be a bad guy, but he keeps being tempted to do good. That’s more or less what he says when he’s praying at his Darth Vader shrine – a shrine to a guy who ended up being good, no less, which I think further lends credence to my idea that Ren is an ass-backwards weirdo. And, while I find his pent-up teenage angst to be an interesting choice, that motivation doesn’t work for me because it doesn’t make any sense. The only reason it exists is to be a mirror of Anakin and Luke’s struggles in the other two trilogies, but “good person tempted by evil” is a more believable story trope than the opposite. If you’re a good person who really wants to do bad, guess what? You’re not actually a good person. Your conflict is nonexistent.</p>

<p>And, on the subject of badassery, I’m curious, Bethany, did you continue to feel that way as the movie went on? To me, Ren’s crowning moment of awesome is the stopping of that blaster bolt – literally the first thing he does in the movie. You see him read Poe’s mind later, which is pretty cool, but after that it’s mostly tantrums until the end of the movie, where he is bested multiple times (in the mind-reading scene and in the lightsaber battle) by a girl who doesn’t know what the Force is and who has never held a lightsaber before. Is he supposed to suck, or is this a giant misstep on the filmmakers’ part?</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: I think the whole idea is that they set up his badassery, as you call it, early on so there’s less of a need to constantly see him being badass all the time (which would probably get old to some extent, like, “We know, he can stop bolts and read people’s minds. We get it.”). They just end up showing us other layers to his personality. And regardless of how you see it, whether you like it or don’t, the struggle of a bad guy being tempted by good isn’t one we see all of the time, which is refreshing. I agree, and said before, that I’d like to understand more of his motivation, and I'll also admit that if the reason that is ultimately revealed in subsequent movies for the personal break in relationship between Kylo’s father and mother isn’t strong enough, that will likely detract at least a little from my enjoyment of him in this movie. But there’s just enough mystery for now that I’m still fully on board.</p>

<p>As for Kylo being unable to hold his own toward the end of the film, it doesn’t show weakness on his part, but shows the sheer epic strength of Rey instead. It is setting up her character for us to see that, even though she has no training and only thinks of stories of the Force as lore, she is still so freaking strong with the Force that she is able to power against Kylo Ren and take him down.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: You’re saying her midichlorian readings are off the charts?</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: Heh, don’t put words no one wants to use in my mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: I don’t buy the “Rey is so freaking strong” bit. Watching Kylo being beaten by an untrained girl was completely unbelievable to me. Kylo is a descendant of Anakin Skywalker, supposedly the most powerful Force user the galaxy has ever seen. Granted, he is the grandson, but he should still be pretty strong; plus, he has actually been trained to use a lightsaber (and I think it is implied he killed all of Luke’s other apprentices). The idea that Rey is somehow more powerful than him is preposterous to me. I think it is a big misstep for the film to have Kylo beaten. It removes what little threat he had in him.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Well, Mark, you’re beginning to touch on Rey, so let’s move to her, next. I have a feeling she may actually be the character on whom we most disagree. While Bethany obviously has a penchant for Luke Skywalker’s spiritual successor, I think Mark (and, I’ll be honest, me too) is reacting against what he sees as her role as wish-fulfillment character. Whereas Luke and even “special” Anakin had to go through training to be able to competently operate as Jedi, Rey is immediately super-awesome and good at everything with no development or character arc at all. Daisy Ridley does mostly charming work in the role (except for her angry acting… watch the part where BB-8 wants to come with her and you’ll see a most unconvincing pout), but her character is too good, too soon. She even uses a Jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper, despite, as far as we know, never having heard of such a thing!</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: Rey is not acting as a competent Jedi here, but as someone with natural gifts in the force (as you might expect from someone who is strongly rumored to be Luke’s daughter). Let’s take the two examples you listed: mind trick and saber fight. Right before the mind trick, we see Kylo Ren attempt to infiltrate her mind, and she is strong enough to fight him back automatically. It’s not too much of a leap for her to figure out that she can do a similar thing. With the sword fight, I don’t think they really portrayed her as super-competent—she wasn’t doing prequel flips and stuff. I think she was probably around the level of Luke in Empire, which is plausible because of her staff-fighting experience.</p>

<p>I am trying to think of ways to prove that Rey is awesome, and I’m sort of coming up short, but she just is. You watch her, and you like her. When Han offers her a job on his ship, you want her to take it. When you see her grab the lightsaber and even somewhat competently fight back, you’re excited by it. And maybe that is because she’s a little bit of a Mary Sue, but I liked it.</p>

<p>I think there is something exciting about having an exciting main female character in Star Wars as well. There’s a literally minute-long video that’s been going around recently showing all of the non-Leia dialogue by a woman in the original trilogy, so it’s really nice to see another female character in a primary role. One of the really cool things about Star Wars is how the series creates creative play with kids, and I think it’s really cool for little girls to have someone they can relate to who is a main driving force (ha ha) in the series.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Rey is a bit more muddled for me. I really like her story, a scavenger who was abandoned on a planet. She is Force-sensitive, but unlike everyone else, she doesn’t want it. It’s unique, and I like that. Unfortunately, the execution of the character was a bit mixed for me. I’m not sure if this is because of acting or writing (perhaps a bit of both), but I wasn’t a big fan. As far as female characters go, I still like (original trilogy) Leia best.</p>

<img src="/img/rey-mask.jpg" alt="" class="post-pic">

<p class="caption">Whatever your opinion on Rey, she has an awesome mask.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: Surprise, surprise, I agree with Vanasse. I think there isn’t really enough information in this movie to decide whether she should be able to do this stuff or not. But because she can, she does, and right now that’s more than enough for me. Keep in mind we have three full movies with the other main characters. Granted, that also means we have six movies of backstory and “rules,” but the beauty is all of those rules can be broken given the right circumstances.</p>

<p>Talking strictly from a story perspective (and not a “how awesome is it that we have a kick-ass female character” perspective, which I’ll touch on in a second), it feels too nitpicky right now to say this character wouldn’t be able to do this or that. We only have theory right now of her backstory. The idea that Kylo Ren should be the strongest because he’s Vader’s grandson is yet to be determined because, as Vanasse mentioned, Rey may or may not also be the grand-descendant of Vader. I admit that her “zen” moment of closing her eyes and suddenly the Force is a little much, but not enough to detract from the overall strength of the character.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily want to spend too much time on the “how awesome is it to have a kick-ass female character” because I’m sure there will be much written on that topic, but as I walked away from this film, I said, “Where was that kind of female character when I was a kid?” Even Leia, who we all know and love, isn’t this strong or well-rounded. She’s still a princess, after all, no matter how un-princess-like. The part where Finn and Rey are running away from the attack at the Jakku junk-yard, and Rey keeps being so confused about why Finn keeps trying to hold her hand … I know this was put in there as a “Hey, look at me, I’m not a damsel in distress, and I can take care of myself” moment, and even with it being a little heavy handed, I just loved it so much.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: I’m definitely on board with more awesome ladies in the Star Wars universe. One of the delights of watching “The Clone Wars” is seeing Ahsoka develop from a one-note apprentice into a fully-formed, independent Jedi. Again, however, that process of maturation takes time. Rey’s backstory completely justifies, say, her proficiency with tools and tinkering, but I just don’t buy her quick ascendancy to Force user status.</p>

<p>However, I suspect we’re just not going to agree on that aspect of the character, so <a href="/post/tfa-roundtable-4">next time</a> let’s move on to something I hope we all can agree on: how awesome were Finn & Poe, Space Bros? </p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: Finally! Something we agree on!</p>
