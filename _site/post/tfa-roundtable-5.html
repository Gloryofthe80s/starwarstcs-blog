            <div class="post-content">
              <p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: We’ve spent a lot of time so far talking about the story and characters of “The Force Awakens,” but thus far we haven’t really touched on one of the most important parts of any Star Wars movie: the visual element. This discussion may end up ranging far and wide, but one of the things I think is most interesting about the film is its use of special effects – particularly when it uses practical effects vs. CGI. In the lead-up to the movie, there was talk about how Abrams was going to use practical effects as much as possible, only utilizing computers when necessary, and at times, that’s true. BB-8 is famously a real, concrete thing. However, given that lead-up, I was surprised at how often the movie used CGI in places where the original movie would have subbed in a model or a puppet. We already talked a little about Maz and Snoke as characters, but Mark, what did you think of the use of CGI for them, as well as the CGI/practical divide throughout the movie as a whole?</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: The use of CGI is really interesting in this movie. It seemed to me that most of the aliens were done as physical persons with makeup and prosthetics (Snoke and Maz aside). I was pretty impressed with the look of everything in the cantina. I was disappointed that most of the starships appeared to be CGI. The models of the ships always looked better, and I think it is one of the great strengths of the original trilogy that they relied on those models so heavily.</p>

<p>The other thing I would say is the graphics feel like 2015 CGI. That goes for most of the rest of the movie as well: the colors and shading and tone of the whole thing feels straight out of a Marvel movie. I can’t tell right now if I think that’s a good or bad thing. In some ways I think it is necessary for the films to be of the era in which they are made, but I do think that it will also be more dated in the long run – not that longevity matters for ticket sales.</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: I don’t think the spaceships have been practical models since pre-1996 at least. The Special Edition stuff was almost all digital, and of course the prequels were. </p>

<p>And I’m not entirely opposed to that—it allows a lot of freedom in the movement of the ships, which, when handled correctly in editing and shooting, can result in a fantastically kinetic movie. Here, we had that one shot where Poe takes out something like 10 TIE fighters while Finn watches from the ground. That was fantastic, just a breathtaking shot. And the escape from the Star Destroyer was fabulous as well. </p>

<p>I’ve been saying all along that this seems like a really undeniably 2015 movie to me, and while I was more referring to the editing, pacing, and story structure of the movie, the effects and look of the film place it in that realm too. It’s interesting to me that they ballyhooed the fact that they shot this movie on 35mm film stock, since I really don’t think it had that film look like you might expect from that.</p>

<p>I have referred to the other movies as more timeless, and I think that’s true, but I suspect we’ll have to wait five years or so to really know.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: I have a lot to say about the ships, but I’ll hold off for the time being because most of what I have to say on the matter more relates to the art design and shooting style. Regarding the rest of the CGI, I’m a little hesitant, because there are some parts of the movie when I thought, “that’s CGI,” but I could be proven wrong in the future. For example, I thought a lot of the aliens in the cantina did look like they were CGI, but I’ve only seen the movie once so far, and I’m willing to be proven wrong on that score.</p>

<p>To me, computer effects should be used as little as possible. As I’ve said before, I kind of like “Indiana Jones 4,” but I could live without ever seeing Shia LaBeouf swing from tree to tree with digital monkeys ever again. Oddly enough, though the prequels are often slammed for their prodigious use of graphic elements (I believe Episode III was essentially shot entirely on a soundstage), I think about the digital effects less when I’m watching them because the whole movie is shot that way. In a strange sense, the complete unreality creates a new reality where the characters can live.</p>

<p>For a movie that was trying to recapture original Star Wars, however, it seemed like there was an awful lot of CGI. Unless you really do it right, CGI can look weightless, and one of the best things about the original movies is that everything had weight and heft. Snoke in particular just doesn’t register visually, though perhaps some of that is because he’s a hologram, as well.</p>

<img src="/img/tfa-cantina.jpg" alt="" class="post-pic">

<p class="caption">How much of the cantina scene was practical? We're not sure.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: The CGI was definitely at opposite ends of the spectrum here for me. Some of it was really great, and some of it was mediocre. There are a lot of reasons this may be the case (and not all of them simply choices made by the director), but ultimately that probably doesn’t really matter. I will say that when I left the theater, I wanted to talk much more about the VFX of it all than I ended up doing (chalk that up to an 11 p.m. screening) because I went with a bunch of friends of mine who work at a VFX house. I really wanted to get their take, and hopefully I still will in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I think that where CGI tends to shine is in enhancing practical effects or in creating elements that literally cannot be done otherwise,or could be but would be cost prohibitive. I think some of it was used really well here, and some of it … not so much. Of course, there is always the fact that some of it isn’t obvious or clear how they did certain things, especially on a first viewing, so some of these examples may be proved wrong, just like you guys have mentioned.</p>

<p>The biggest issues I had were similar to what’s already been mentioned. Snoke was a big one, but I could get over it a little because he was a hologram. Maz was a disappointment as well, not in that she was done poorly, really, but just in that I wish she would have been a puppet. Same with the junkyard owner, Unkar (who incidentally reminded me a lot of Dexter Jettster). </p>

<p>Where I think the CGI really shined, and I’m sure there will be a lot of dissent, was in enhancing practical elements, such as BB-8. While we all do know there was a practical droid zipping around on set, there had to have been times that he wasn’t real. When BB-8 has attached himself to the Millennium Falcon to keep himself from rolling everywhere? That was definitely enhanced by VFX, and possibly a fully CGI BB-8 there. I would also bet that Admiral Akbar was enhanced with VFX as well, and I really wish they would have utilized the idea of blending methods more. Make Maz a puppet, but give her tracking markers on her face so you could add a more realistic mouth and more realistic eye movements later. Have a giant guy in a suit for the junkyard guy, but make his limbs green so you can track on more flail-y limbs.</p>

<p>I also really loved all of the matte paintings in this film. Regardless of what you think of what they were of (in a story/nostalgia sense), the giant crashed ships looming in the background of Jakku were breathtaking. I was digging on the castle on Takodana as well.</p>

<img src="/img/maz-cgi.jpg" alt="" class="post-pic">

<p class="caption">Maz: good design, or unnecessary digital imagery?</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: One place where the CGI definitely didn’t work for me was those monsters on the Han Solo salvage ship. As I was watching that whole sequence, I was thinking, “Yup, clearly a JJ Abrams movie.” I don’t even know why, but they just seemed very generic and unremarkable. But while I agree with Ryan about the prequels and their use of CGI, I thought that for the most part CG stuff was well-integrated, generally had heft, etc. That said, still glad they went practical for BB-8. That was probably the most likable new piece of technology in the whole thing.</p>

<p>Ryan, were you mentioning earlier that there weren’t really any new ships in this movie? For a franchise so tightly entwined with merch, I’m a little surprised there wasn’t something more original. I will say that after I watched this, I wanted to run out and buy a starfighter, but I was more hankering for the N-1 from Episode I, of all things (Though the riffs on classic TIEs, Star Destroyers, and X-wings were still pretty engaging. TIE fighters have turrets now!).</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Yeah, let’s move on to the design of the movie (and I can’t fault you for wanting an N-1, Ryan; those ships are dope). I was pretty disappointed with what was on display here, for the most part. BB-8 looks pretty cool (even though some the shenanigans he gets up to while on the Falcon smack a little bit of the prequels’ “R2-D2 can do anything!” aesthetic), but there really isn’t very much new to look at here, and what new there is (looking at you again, Maz and Snoke) isn’t super interesting.</p>

<p>I’ve said it before, but Star Wars, originals and prequels, was always about creating something new. Every movie had new aliens, new ships and new technology that always looked cool, and this movie just doesn’t, for the most part. The X-wings are so similar as to not be immediately distinguishable from their earlier counterparts (other than that they’re digitally rendered while flying), and while the TIE fighter redesign is pretty neat, the new Star Destroyers look appreciably worse. </p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: Hey, I have one of those Star Destroyers; they’re pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Eh, give me that stark white hull any day of the week. One thing I found particularly strange was that, for a movie so obsessed with the past, this movie actually has fewer ships than the original “New Hope” did. There are no blockade runners and no Y-wings, to say nothing of the other wing models and TIEs we see in the next two movies. Did the Republic just stop making B-wings? Would it have killed the First Order to keep their technology up-to-date by throwing in a TIE defender or something?</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: To be fair, even in the canon, B-wings are acknowledged as mostly sucking.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: No way, man! Ion cannons!</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: They’re slow and unmaneuverable and can’t dogfight TIEs! They practically need their own protection (huge shields and durability aside). Not terrible for a capital ship attack, I suppose, but the Republic/Resistance could do better in 30 years.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: I’d rather be in one of them than in a Y-wing, but point taken. Throw an A-wing into this movie, then.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: The lack of ships was a big disappointment. Even the Starkiller was the same old design as the Death Star: a giant ball. No originality at all. Maybe it's not entirely unexpected given Abram’s track record with the new Star Trek, but it would have been great to see something new.</p>

<p>Also, Ryan H., you are wrong about BB-8. He’s awesome, and one of highlights of the film. He’s funny, he looks good, he has character. Sure, he’s clearly riffing off of R2, but it works well. He’s got a handful of gadgets that are cool but reasonable, nothing like those ridiculous rocket boosters.</p>

<p><strong>Vanasse</strong>: Eh, those zip line things in the Falcon were kind of close.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Close, but it makes sense that a droid that has to roll everywhere may have something to help him get around.</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: I don’t have much to add in the general discussion of Star Wars ships new and old. But what I hear you guys saying is “I want to see cool new ships, and there weren’t any.” However, I tend to look at it more from a story/realism perspective. I mean, in the last 30 years, have we seen drastically different airplanes, or even cars for that matter, appear on the scene? Sure, there might be advancements in technology, or the size of an airplane may have changed (I’m looking at you, A380). Or the livery. Or small aspects. But a plane from the 1980s looks a lot like a plane built today. I won’t touch on military technology too much because I am by no means educated enough in that department, but I will say this: technology overall has changed there, but planes and helicopters still look generally the same.</p>

<p>And to make the case from the perspective of Star Wars, this fight has been going on for 30 years. The First Order is going to build upon the technology they already have. That’s what people do. If the Death Star was going to work theoretically, it doesn’t make sense to them to go all the way back to the drawing board to design something new. They already had what they wanted (I won’t get into the plot point of building the exact same flaws into this new Death Star because it was probably the weakest part of the movie, so let’s just move on). It's the same with ship technology like the TIE fighters. And the Republic doesn’t seem nearly strong enough to start churning out a bunch of new ships. They’re probably just duct taping their X-wings back together at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan H.</strong>: Well, if I wanted to see a “realistic” science fiction movie, I wouldn't be watching Star Wars, but even given your argument, the variations on most of the tech (excluding the Stormtrooper uniforms, which are nicely updated) are virtually nil. If you look back at planes from the Vietnam War, sure, they still have two wings like modern planes, but they still look pretty different. Though the prequels' real-world technology often led to the problem of its fictional technology looking better than the original, “later” movies, they did a nice job at showing small hints of the future tech of Episodes IV, V and VI. Note in particular ships like the Jedi Starfighter, a clear homage to the A-wing while also being appreciably different in form and function.</p>

<p>Mentioning the prequels, however, leads me to my biggest criticism of “The Force Awakens'” art direction: with the exception of BB-8 and the ruined Imperial craft on Jakku, there is little that is truly visually striking about the film. Vanasse earlier mentioned the rathtars, clearly designed to be the movie's “monster sequence,” but that scene and those monsters can't hold a candle to the dianoga in the trash compactor, “Empire's” wampa or space slug, or Luke fighting the rancor. Sure, it looks better than the superimposed beast in ROTJ, but it's nowhere near as visually distinctive or fun. Moving away from practical effects, it's not even as good as Episode II's all-CGI arena beast fight. Of all of the Lucas films, it's most evocative of the muddled and quippy bongo escape in Episode I. There's always a bigger rathtar. The prequels may look bad in many parts to our modern eyes, but Lucas was swinging for the fences with his attempts at artistic display. In “The Force Awakens,” Snoke, Maz and the Starkiller don't just look bad – they look boring, and so does much of the rest of the film's new or not-so-new elements.</p>

<p>We could probably go on about the art design forever, but let's move on to some of the other filmmaking techniques. Next time, we'll take a look at how this movie appears to be made and whether it feels like a Star Wars film.</p>
