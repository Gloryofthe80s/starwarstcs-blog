              <p><b>Ryan H.</b>: All of us here at Star Wars: The Completionist Saga are fresh off of watching “Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens.” Ryan H. and Mark saw it together on Thursday night, Ryan V. watched it Friday morning, and Bethany caught a late showing Friday night. We’ve gathered today to discuss our current thoughts on the movie, with the acknowledgment that these opinions could shift and change in the coming days with more thought and repeat viewings. Ryan V., I’ll let you kick things off. What did you think of “The Force Awakens”?</p>

<p><b>Vanasse</b>: I think that acknowledgment is key, Ryan. Throughout my showing, I couldn’t really get a handle on my feelings on the movie. I came out of it both liking it a lot and feeling underwhelmed and nitpicky at the same time. One of the key things that I felt is that this <i>feels</i> like a very 2015 movie. The original trilogy is of course timeless, but even the prequels felt like in their own time and place rather than being “turn of the century” flicks—awkward CGI aside.</p>

<p>The story and especially the editing of “The Force Awakens” has this very “This is how movies are made in 2015” feel to it, with the speed, how the story develops, the use of these mysteries to drive the sequel, etc. It doesn’t feel timeless...yet. But it may feel better on further viewings.</p>

<p><b>Mark</b>: I too feel very conflicted. During the movie, I found myself enjoying it (most of the time), but after leaving the theater I don’t know that I liked it that much. Would I be excited to see it again? Not really. It doesn’t quite have the emotional resonance of the earlier movies. Even the “twist” where Han dies at the hand of his son left me with no emotional response. </p>

<p><b>Vanasse</b>: Oh yeah, that felt unearned. It doesn’t help that they’re aping ANH with Finn and Rey showing up just in time to see Han get struck down. I don’t think it was the acting—Ford and Driver were bringing it—just that moment in the story didn’t have time to breathe at all. </p>

<p><b>Bethany</b>: Interesting perspectives. I loved it, actually. And everything I’ve heard from others has been generally the same response. So I like hearing something a little different here. I even got caught up in the sheer thrill and excitement of it all. There are a few things I can definitely dive into that I didn’t love, but just as a general overall, I can’t really say anything bad.</p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: I’m also glad that Mark and Ryan went first, because it’s nice to have that moderation between extremes -- and I do mean extremes. I’ll be honest: I really hated this movie. I thought it was hacky and poorly made and most of all, that it was just a giant string of references to the original trilogy, stripped of meaning and meant only to evoke the nostalgia we had for the old ones without creating anything new. Disney’s first Star Wars movie isn’t momentous for being the first one in a decade or the first one not overseen by George Lucas. It’s historic because it’s the first time we have more bad Star Wars episodes than good ones.</p>

<p><b>Bethany</b>: Wow, really? This is all so fascinating to me. You’re right, this is momentous for it being the first not overseen by George Lucas, and maybe that leads a little into exactly <i>why</i> I liked it. But I’ll jump off more on your point of it relying too heavily on the nostalgia factor. For me, I didn’t really grow up with the Star Wars like most did, so I didn’t feel like this was too “wink-wink-nudge-nudge” all of the time. I liked the parts where it did that (which in my opinion weren’t over the top and were more subtle). I think they did it just enough to please fans but kept a lot of fresh ideas and plotlines in there to keep the story moving forward.</p>

<p><b>Vanasse</b>: I hear what you’re saying, Ryan, but you’re completely wrong. There were a <i>lot</i> of nods, yes, and a lot of really familiar story beats—not all of which worked. But TFA has a lot of originality too. Finn’s a former stormtrooper. That’s something we’ve never seen before. The family drama of the wayward son and his internal conflicts about the light side and the dark is very different from any of the family drama in the other trilogies, and I think that all the parts of that family really act the hell out of that. Rey fills a really similar part in the plot to Luke, but is distinctly her own original character, whom I really loved. </p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: Now <i>I’m</i> the one who thinks you’re completely wrong, but I’ll cede for Mark for now.</p>

<p><b>Mark</b>: The fan service is the piece of the movie that makes me most conflicted. There are definitely new points, but it seems most of the movie is trying to reference the original, if not plot related, then visually. I’m ok with it to some extent: the prequels echo a lot of things from the original trilogy, but TFA takes it too far. </p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: OK, we’re starting to delve into the plot a little, so for organization’s sake, let’s break this down into the individual elements of the film so we can talk about story, characters, graphics, editing, etc. We can start with the plot.</p>

<p>I joked to Vanasse yesterday that I liked “The Force Awakens” a lot back when it was called “A New Hope,” and he gave me a digital eye roll, but I think that’s a legitimate criticism. In fact, out of all of the complaints I have about the movie, and there are several, this is the biggest one by far. I was actually really on board at the beginning of the movie. The scene where Finn and Poe break out of the Star Destroyer is great, and I didn’t mind the thematic echoes of BB-8 with the MacGuffin map, either. But it became clear very quickly that any new elements of the script would be grafted on to an overall story that is the same as the first Star Wars film.</p>

<p>Think about the plot of this movie. It’s about an orphan on a planet so similar to Tatooine that I thought it was Tatooine until we see it only has one sun (there are even moisture vaporators!). She and some buddies (including Han and Chewie) are tasked with bringing a robot with a hologram in it to a bunch of freedom fighters. Before they get there, they stop in a cantina with a bunch of weird aliens, and once they arrive on not-Yavin IV, they find out that they have to blow up a giant battle station that can blow up planets. They even have to fly their X-wing fighters into a trench to do it! The only modifications to the story come in the order (Rey gets stuck on Starkiller Base, whose name is a deep-cut reference I actually like, <i>as</i> the assault is occurring rather than before) and in the additions of plot elements from Episodes V and VI (the father/son elements, the fact that the Resistance must also deactivate the Starkiller’s shields before the trench run can happen).</p>

<p><b>Bethany</b>: While I agree that many of the plot points are similar, I think that’s not a bad thing here. I think by focusing on how it is “A New Hope,” you’re missing out on all of the other character development that goes on and also <i>how</i> the story is told. I feel like it’s pretty natural that they would mirror a lot of elements of that first movie. And I feel like “The Phantom Menace” does this as well. If you think of it more of the idea of a family lineage, I think it makes sense to repeat certain aspects and/or themes.</p>

<p><b>Mark</b>: I agree that there should be <i>some</i> “echoes” of the story. But the list of plot points that are similar is pretty long. I think that is part of what makes it difficult for me to think about watching it again. </p>

<p>That being said, I think the new plot elements were pretty good. I like the idea that Han and Leia’s son went bad, and Luke feels responsible. I think this is a good transition into the new movies. I hate the fact that Han and Leia are estranged because of it, but in principle I like the focus on the Skywalker family’s struggle with the dark side.</p>

<p><b>Vanasse</b>: It’s all standard Hero’s Journey stuff anyway, so the supposed unoriginality doesn’t bother me. It did bother me that they used our affection for the previous stories to evoke emotional responses we wouldn’t have had otherwise. And I’m not talking about say, it getting a little dusty when Han and Leia reconnect. That’s just familiarity with the characters. But for example, the new “Cantina Scene” leaned on our recognition that this was the new Cantina Scene to say what it was about. Or when Han died. When the movie says “You should feel this way because you felt this way previously” rather than earning it with its new characters.</p>

<p>The similar plot beats were also a little disappointing just because it means that there were fewer opportunities to expand on the original parts of this film. We really didn’t get enough of the “stormtrooper experience,” I thought. We only barely got enough of Organa-Solo family elements and Kylo Ren angst. I could have done with a little more. Instead we have to rush to yet an even bigger giant base that needs booming.</p>

<p>I was also disappointed when slavishly fulfilling the old plot beats meant that the new plot didn’t make as much sense. What system did the First Order destroy and how would that mean the end of the Resistance/Republic? Why did a <i>weaker</i> “Empire” decide to devote their resources to a giant superweapon? It doesn’t really make sense outside of “Gotta make a movie like that ANH.”</p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: You’re 100 percent right about the new plot points getting short shrift. A lot of hay is made about the prequels having a confusing, hard-to-follow metaplot, but this was just as bad. At first, I thought the planet they blew up was Coruscant, until they say a different name later in the movie (and is it just me, or is the moment of Hosnian Prime’s destruction super underplayed? There’s nothing like the emotion we see from Leia when Alderaan bites it). I have no idea what the First Order’s place in the galaxy is or how it relates to the Republic, nor do I know why the Republic and the Resistance have to be different things. Plot economy would suggest that it make more sense to have the Republic fighting the First Order directly, rather than going through some sort of pass-through, but the way it’s set up is clearly done to evoke the Rebel Alliance of the original films, rather than the original Republic of the prequels. I could better explain what the Trade Federation does than how those three entities fit together.</p>

<p>And since I’ve mentioned the prequels, let’s blow the lid off, shall we? You’re all talking a lot about the movies echoing each other, and that makes a lot of sense. Even Lucas, when describing the prequels, has said that they’re supposed to “rhyme” with the original trilogy. But there’s a difference between rhyming and doing a cover version. For all of their flaws, and those flaws are legion, the prequels were doing something <i>different</i>. They were an attempt to break new ground in the Star Wars universe, to tell a different kind of story, to hearken back to old serials and Joseph Campbell and the exciting adventures Lucas experienced as a child. This movie only hearkens back to itself, and it does so seemingly only to please fans who are prequel-phobic. I know this is nu-heresy to say, but here goes: though the prequel movies are technically more poorly made than “The Force Awakens,” they’re also a hell of a lot more interesting because they’re trying to be their own damn thing.</p>

<p><b>Bethany</b>: Don’t worry, Ryan, I’m not going to tell you you’re wrong <i>again</i>. But I was extremely relieved that “The Force Awakens” was nothing like the prequels in a lot of ways. I recently rewatched “The Phantom Menace” in order to better understand what was going on and I felt only slightly as though I really understood and felt even more like I didn’t give a crap. So. Much. Trade Federation stuff. I really enjoyed that “The Force Awakens” was much more about the characters and their individual struggles. Not knowing some of the details of the story is just what happens when you are going along for a ride with specific characters. The prequels seem to me to be more about the galaxy as a whole (for better or worse, depending on your opinion), but I prefer feeling connected to the universe through people.</p>

<p>I will agree that I wish we spent more time on developing some of these relationships. I’m hoping for more of that as this next batch of movies goes on. Maybe because I actually enjoyed the characters, but I just wanted to see so much more of the Han/Leia dynamic and just get even a tiny bit more understanding into the backstory with Luke and Kylo.</p>

<p><b>Ryan H.</b>: I’ll put in a pin in your statement about this movie being nothing like the prequels, because I’d like to come back to that when we talk about the new characters, but since you mentioned it, next time we'll explore the Han/Leia/Kylo stuff.
